# Swiftris
Tetris game for iOS written in swift

I am following this tutorial:
[Swiftris tutorial](https://www.bloc.io/tutorials/swiftris-build-your-first-ios-game-with-swift)

It is really well explained and you can do it even you do not know Swift programming language.
I am also learning swift at the same time I am developing this project.

Do it and have fun ;)
